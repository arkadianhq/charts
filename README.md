# ArkadianHQ's Public GA Helm Repo
> Note: ArkadianHQ's public helm repo is hosted on Github Pages. If you'd like a better QoS and and think maintaining a production helm repo is too much at the moment, consider sponsoring to gain access to the private helm repo.

## Usage
* Add ArkadianHQ's helm repo

```shel
$ helm repo add arkadianhq https://charts.arkadianhq.com
```

* Check for updates - because that is a good thing to do :yum:

```shell
$ helm repo update arkadianhq
```

* Search for a chart

```shell
$ helm search repo arkadianhq
```
